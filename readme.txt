== Description ==
This plugin keeps the HTML of your navigation menu links clean by removing extraneous CSS classes from the each list item. Those classes are simply replaced by the target page's slug (e.g. class="home"). 

The current page's list item is given an additional "current-menu-item" so it can be highlighted. It that page is a submenu item, then its parent is is also given an additional "current-menu-parent" class you can use in your theme's style to highlight it as well.

In case AJAX is used to download the selected page, your JavaScript code can read the "data-id" or "data-slug" attribute to fetch that record from the server.
